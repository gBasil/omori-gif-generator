This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It uses the [Geist](https://geist-ui.dev/) design system and components.

## Getting Started

If needed, utility scripts to generate the backgrounds and character images are provided. Figuring out how to use them is on you.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
